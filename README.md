### slogans

ðŸ”´Develop using reactjs a component of type dropdown (or combobox)
ðŸ”´The project must be run in a docker container

ðŸ”´The model in firebase will consist of the following attributes:
1. name
2. business name
3. nit (cuit)
4. phone
5. code
ðŸ”´When deployed, it will consult a firebase service looking for matches according to the written text (or without a filter, in case no text has been written).

ðŸ”´Should request results paginated by 20 by 20, and should only fetch the next page when scrolling near the bottom of the current list of results.


ðŸ”´It must allow parameterizing by which attribute of the object will be searched. Parameterization should be done by code, not at runtime.

ðŸ”´ The first result of the dropdown must be a fixed option that, when clicked, raises a small pop-up, part of the component, that allows adding a new object with the text already entered, but also allowing editing before saving.

ðŸ”´Attach also within the repository, screenshots of the working solution.
